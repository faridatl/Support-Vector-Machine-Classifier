# Support Vector Machine (SVM):

The Glass Dataset from the UCI machine learning repository was motivated by criminilogical investigation. Glass left at the scene of a crime can be used as evidence if it is correctly identified. This is a study of classification for seven types of glass. This dataset comes with 10 features/attributes used to determmine the class of the glass. 5-Fold cross validation is employed to evaluate the classification performance of an SVM classifier. The confusion matrix, sensitivity, specificity, overall model accuracy, F1-score, and ROC & AUC Curve are metrix calculated used to determine how well the model performed.
